# C++ Grid Processing Project

## Overview

This project is a C++ application that processes grids of characters. It could be used for a variety of purposes, such as solving puzzles or analyzing patterns within the grids. The project includes several grid data files and a C++ source file that implements the required functionality.

## Features

- Reads grids from text files.
- Processes the grids to perform specific operations (e.g., searching for words, analyzing patterns).
- Outputs results based on the processing logic implemented.

## Files

- `Project1.cpp`: The main C++ source file containing the implementation.
- `grid1.txt`, `grid2.txt`, `grid3.txt`: Sample grid data files used for input.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Makefile (optional, if you want to automate the build process)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository and Compile the Project**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-grid-processing.git
   cd cpp-grid-processing
  
2. **Compile the Project**
   
    `g++ Project1.cpp -o grid_processor`

4. **Run the application**
   
   `./grid_processor grid1.txt`
